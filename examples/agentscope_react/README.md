# AgentScope ReAct Agent Training Example

This example demonstrates how to train the [AgentScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope) built-in ReAct Agent using Trinity-RFT. We use the GSM8K dataset as an example. Developers can refer to this example to adapt Trinity-RFT's training to their own agent projects.
