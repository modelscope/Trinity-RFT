# Email Search Workflow

This example shows a multi-turn email search workflow, inspired by [ART](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent?refresh=1756431423904). We implement a ReAct Agent and define tools for email search. Note that this example requires installing [AgentScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation).

For more detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](../../docs/sphinx_doc/source/tutorial/example_search_email.md).

The config file is located in [`email_search.yaml`](email_search.yaml).
